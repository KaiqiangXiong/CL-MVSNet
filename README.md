# CL-MVSNet
CL-MVSNet is an unsupervised multi-view stereo model, which integrates two contrastive branches into an unsupervised MVS framework to construct supervisory signals. Besides, an L0.5 photometric consistency loss is adopted to encourage the model to focus more on accurate points.

Details are described in our paper:

CL-MVSNet is more robust on theindistinguishable regions and view-dependent effects. The point cloud is more complete and accurate than previous methods.

## ⚙ Setup
#### 1. Recommended environment
- PyTorch 1.10
- Python 3.7

#### 2. DTU Dataset

**Training Data**. Download [DTU training data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDjh-_bxKKnEuz5h-HXS7EDJn59clx6V/view) and [Depth raw](https://virutalbuy-public.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/share/cascade-stereo/CasMVSNet/dtu_data/dtu_train_hr/Depths_raw.zip). 
Unzip them and put the `Depth_raw` to `dtu_training` folder. The structure is just like:
```
dtu_training                          
       ├── Cameras                
       ├── Depths   
       ├── Depths_raw
       └── Rectified
```
**Testing Data**. Download [DTU testing data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/135oKPefcPTsdtLRzoDAQtPpHuoIrpRI_/view) and unzip it. The structure is just like:
```
origin                          
	├── scan1                
	├── scan2   
       		├── cams
			├── 00000000_cam.txt
			├── 00000001_cam.txt
			├── ...
		├── images
			├── 00000000.jpg
			├── 00000001.jpg
			├── ...
		└── pair.txt
	├── ...
```


## 📊 Testing

#### DTU testing

**Note:** `pretrained_model/model.ckpt` is the model trained on DTU without any finetuning.

```
bash ./scripts/dtu_test.sh
```

## ⏳ Training

#### DTU training

```
bash ./scripts/dtu_train.sh
